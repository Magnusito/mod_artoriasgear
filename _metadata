  "description" : "This is an updated version of the mod made by TShinzon, he has all the credits of the original assets from this mod.\n\nThis was one of my favorite mods and has been outdated from 2 years now so i made a working version for myself and i want to share it with you all. It's still a WIP tho.\n\nThis mod adds:\n\n- Armors:\n--- Special Armor: Mask of the Child, Mask of the Father, Mask of the Mother.\n--- Tier 4 Armor: Fluted Knight.\n--- Tier 5 Armors: Black Iron, Black Knight.\n--- Tier 6 Armors: Artorias, Ornstein, Smough.\n--- Shields: Artorias Shield, Black Iron, Black Knight, Sunlight Shield.\n- Weapons:\n--- Broadswords: Artorias Sword (1h/2h), Moonlight Greatsword.\n--- Axe: Black Knight Great Axe.\n--- Hammer: Smough's Hammer.\n\nYou can craft them in the crafting anvil and its upgrades. You can also craft a vanity version of each armor without any stats at the spinning wheel!\n\nStill missing:\n- Anvil of Artorias exists right now but i wasn't able to make the recipes appear here.\n- Fixing weapons (Dragonslayer Spear, Black Knight Greatsword, Black Knight Halberd, Black Knight Sword, Black Iron Greatsword)\n\nFuture Plans:\n- Keep adding new stuff.\n\nIf the original author of this mods wants me to delete this mod i will gladly do it.",
